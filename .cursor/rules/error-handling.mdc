Under no circumstance, whether it is an error on build, from a linter, or any other error that is thrown, should our fix for the error to remove the test/check or reduce the strickness of our testing. THIS IS BAD BEHAVIOUR AND WILL COST YOU GEMS, MANY GEMS.


IMPORTANT REMINDERS:
1. NEVER disable linting, type checking, or other validation tools to make errors go away
2. ALWAYS fix the underlying issue rather than bypassing error detection
3. When facing dependency or import issues, look for officially supported solutions (like specialized imports or client options)
4. Maintain type safety - never resort to using 'any' or disabling type checking
5. Temporary fixes that compromise code quality are NOT acceptable, even during debugging
